# Lung_ultrasound_classifier
This repository is dedicated to exploring the most effective optimizers and loss functions for models that classify lung ultrasound images. This work is part of a Bachelor's thesis and aims to enhance diagnostic procedures through the application of AI-driven technologies.

# Data 

### Data Preparation
Each `.ipynb` file contains code for preparing the required data. These files also have detailed information on the training and testing of the models.

### Image Processing Scripts
In the `FilesForImages` folder, you will find modified scripts, sourced from the [POCUS GitHub repository](https://github.com/jannisborn/covid19_ultrasound/), designed for downloading and processing images.

### Data Sources
- **Training and Testing Data**: Obtained from [POCUS](https://github.com/jannisborn/covid19_ultrasound/).
- **Generalization Data**: Sourced from [COVIDx-US](https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/COVID-US).

### Generalization Results
The `Generalization_results` file contains all necessary code for downloading and processing data for generalization tests, along with all related results.

### Model Outputs
The `ModelOutputs` folder contains all models that have been trained and tested.

### External Models
The PocovidNet models were sourced [from here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c_B4V-Ejs45pVyl1QNPEXgT4_Kg0o-Lt). For additional details, please refer to the [POCUS GitHub repository](https://github.com/jannisborn/covid19_ultrasound/).
